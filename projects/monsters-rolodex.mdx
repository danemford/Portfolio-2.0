This project is a visual directory of fictional "monsters," offering users an interactive and dynamic browsing experience. With its card-based interface and real-time search functionality, "Monsters Rolodex" stands as a testament to the seamless integration of design, functionality, and external data sources.

## Tech Stack

Here is the tech stack I used in this project:
- **React:** The core of the application, responsible for building the user interface, managing component state, and handling user interactions.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, TypeScript introduces static types and interfaces to the project, ensuring robustness and maintainability.
- **REST API:** An online server used to dynamically fetch data, populating the Rolodex with diverse monster profiles.

## Features

Here are some of the features:
- Dynamic Search: A real-time search functionality that allows users to filter through the monster profiles, updating the displayed cards based on the search input.
- Card-based Interface: Each monster is elegantly represented as a card, complete with a unique avatar, name, and email, offering users a visually rich browsing experience.
- Responsive Layout: Designed to adapt and look stunning on a variety of devices, from desktops to mobiles.

## Challenges

While integrating TypeScript with React and ensuring the dynamic search functionality worked seamlessly, there were a few learning curves - such as fetching data from the REST API. However, these challenges were valuable learning experiences. 
## Future Improvements

Here are some of the features I would like to add in the future:
- **Detailed Profiles:** An extended view for each monster, providing more in-depth information, such as origin, abilities, and lore.
- **Interactive Animations:** To further engage users with delightful card transitions and hover effects.
- **Theme Toggle:** Offering users the choice between a light and dark mode for a more personalized browsing experience.
