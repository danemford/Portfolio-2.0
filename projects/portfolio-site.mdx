This is my portfolio site built with NextJS, React, Tailwind, and MDX for content management. I built this site to showcase my work, to blog about my experiences, and to learn NextJS and Tailwind.

## Tech Stack

Here is the tech stack I used in this project:
- **NextJS:** A React framework that offers a variety of features, such as server-side rendering and static site generation, to optimize performance and SEO.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-built components, allowing for rapid development and a highly customizable user interface.
- **MDX:** A markdown-based file format that allows for the seamless integration of JSX and React components, offering a more flexible and powerful way to manage content.
- **Vercel:** Deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

## Features

Here are some of the features:
- Clean, Minimalist, Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
- Filter Posts By Category: Users can filter posts by category, allowing them to quickly find the content they are looking for.
- MDX Content Management: The site's content is managed with MDX, allowing local storage and the seamless integration of JSX and React components.

## Challenges

This was my first time using MDX, so I had to learn how to use it and how to integrate it with NextJS.

## Future Improvements

Here are some of the features I would like to add in the future:
- **Dark Mode:** I would like to add a dark mode toggle to the site, allowing users to switch between light and dark mode.
- **Search Functionality:** I would like to add a search bar to the site, allowing users to search for posts by title or content.
- **More Content:** I would like to add more content to the site, including more blog posts and more projects.
