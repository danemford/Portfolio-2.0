Back in 2020, a casual conversation with a friend about endurance events led me to the world of ultra marathons. 

The idea of pushing one's body and mind to the limits was intriguing. My interest was further piqued when I stumbled upon David Goggins' "Can't Hurt Me".

Goggins' journey from adversity to becoming a renowned endurance athlete resonated deeply with me, setting the stage for my own ultra marathon adventure.

### ***The UTA100***

Set against the backdrop of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, the UTA100 is more than just a race; it's a transformative experience.

The trail offers breathtaking views and boasts a staggering 4,400 meters of elevation gain over the 100km distance.

This race is not just about distance; the steep ascents and descents present a unique challenge on their own. Completing the UTA100 is not just about physical prowess; it's a mental game, demanding grit and determination.


### **The First Attempt: A Lesson in Resilience**

My initial foray into the UTA100 in 2021 was filled with enthusiasm and a touch of naivety. I believed passion alone would carry me through. However, the trail had other plans. 

A dull ache in my knee at the 30km mark was a clear signal that my body wasn't ready. By the 60km mark, the pain was unbearable. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I had to withdraw. 

<mark>The realization hit hard: passion needed preparation.</mark>

### **Redemption on the Trail**

That failure became my motivation. I immersed myself in rigorous training, seeking advice from seasoned runners, and understanding my body better. Nutrition, rest, and targeted exercises became my mantra.

Two years later in May of 2023, with scars from the past and hope for the future, I stood at the UTA100 starting line again. Those 16 hours on the trail tested me, but they also rewarded me. 

Crossing the finish line was a testament to my <mark>growth and resilience.</mark>

### **The Coding Journey Begins**

Back in 2014, a casual chat with a friend who was a Software Engineer at Google introduced me to the world of coding. 

The idea of creating something from mere lines of code was fascinating. I promptly started learning Python on Codecademy, envisioning myself becoming a coding savant. 

But reality was different. 

The abstract concepts, the errors, and the lack of a clear learning path overwhelmed me. Within two weeks, I had given up on coding.

### **Rediscovering the Passion for Code**

Years passed, but the ember of coding still glowed within. In 2022, on a whim, I enrolled in Harvard's CS50 - Introduction To Computer Science course. The structured approach, the engaging lectures, and the challenging problem sets rekindled my passion. 

Each solved problem felt like a mini marathon conquered. 

A few weeks in, <mark>a realization dawned: I was meant to code.</mark> 

The satisfaction of problem-solving and the joy of building something from scratch resonated deeply.

### **Perseverance Pays Off**

Armed with the lessons learned and the grit and determination that had been engrained in me from my ultra marathon experiences, I approached coding challenges head-on.

I embraced errors as learning opportunities, sought community help when stuck, and celebrated small victories.

Late nights, endless debugging sessions, and continuous learning became the norm.

But, much like my UTA100 journey, the results were worth the effort. I not only became proficient in coding but also developed a problem-solving mindset.

### **Wrap Up**

Ultra marathon running and coding, at their core, are <mark>journeys of self-discovery.</mark>

They challenge you, break you, but can also rebuild you - as long as you don't give up. 

Both have taught me that with perseverance, the right mindset, and preparation, any challenge, be it a rugged mountain trail or a complex coding problem, can be overcome.
