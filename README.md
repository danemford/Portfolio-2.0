# Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site built with NextJS, React, Tailwind, and MDX for content management.

## Tech Stack

**NextJS**: A React framework that offers a variety of features, such as server-side rendering and static site generation, to optimize performance and SEO.
**TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that offers a wide range of pre-built components, allowing for rapid development and a highly customizable user interface.
**MDX**: A markdown-based file format that allows for the seamless integration of JSX and React components, offering a more flexible and powerful way to manage content.
**Vercel**: Deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.

## Features

Clean, Minimalist, Responsive Design: The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
Filter Posts By Category: Users can filter posts by category, allowing them to quickly find the content they are looking for.
MDX Content Management: The site's content is managed with MDX, allowing local storage and the seamless integration of JSX and React components.
Challenges
This was my first time using MDX, so I had to learn how to use it and how to integrate it with NextJS.

## Future Improvements

Dark Mode: A dark mode toggle to the site, allowing users to switch between light and dark mode.
Search Functionality: A search bar to the site, allowing users to search for posts by title or content.
More Content: I would like to add more content to the site, including more blog posts and more projects.
